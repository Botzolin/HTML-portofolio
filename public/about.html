<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi. I'm Andrew and I am a web developer.</p>

<p>My passion for webdev appeared because of a joke made by one of my friends that told me:"If you don't like this website, do it yourself!".
The website in question was the one used by the University I applied to, it being notorious for crashing all the time.
</p>
<p>
  So here I am. Trying my best to learn and develop my own websites and hopefully one day make a living out of it.
